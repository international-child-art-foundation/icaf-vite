            We believe that children are creators and builders of the future.
            Their imagination is social capital and their art opens a window
            into their world. Children's voices should be heard all around, from
            boardrooms and town halls to the Congress and the UN. Their art
            should be in every contemporary art museum and on the walls of each
            business office.
          </p>

            You can help us empower the children by reforming education to
            foster creativity and infuse it with empathy.{' '}
