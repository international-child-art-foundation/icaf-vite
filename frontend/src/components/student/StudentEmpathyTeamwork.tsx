          Embrace Empathy and Teamwork
        </p>
        <p>
          Creativity is also about understanding others. When you put yourself
          in someone elseâ€™s shoes, you see them as a friend and partner, not a
          competitor. This is called empathy. At ICAF, we believe that by
          working together, we can create amazing things and make the world a
          better place.
