          The ability to see the world through fresh, unbiased eyes is an
          incredible gift. Children have the capacity to observe qualities of
          the world to which adults become blind, and appreciate simple things
          that adults take for granted. Artistic expression gives our children a
          way to connect with us on their own terms and demonstrate these simple
          truths that we have long forgotten.

          The Arts Olympiad competition is about helping children communicate
          their thoughts, ideas, and dreams. It gives children a way to share
          their immensely valuable points of view with their family and peers.
          Most of all, it encourages children to cultivate the habit of open
          self-expression, which will grow with them as they begin to shape the
          world.
